# Swift 2 Card Style Table View #

This is the basic skeleton to create a dynamic card-styled layout in iOS. Still semi-rough, but covers all of the complicated parts (none of this is really too complicated though). 

I'll write better instructions for this as I improve things, but this is the basic stuff

### What does this do? ###

* Dynamically creates "cards" (UITableView sections) with "tables"(UITableViewCells) inside of each card
* Support for large header section outside of the basic card layout
* Says a lot of stuff about Good Charlotte and 311

### How do I use it? ###

* Set up your card data in the `CardDataSource.swift` file
* The cards should magically work

### What's left here? ###

* Better instructions on how to format the cards and set up header areas
* Instructions on how to use this in a real project
* Fix some ugly formatting just because.

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
